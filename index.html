	Tutorial created as I noticed a few people were struggling to 
	dead align their elements so I created this easy to use code, 
	hope it helps.

	Remember to view the style.css to see how it is achieved.

<div class="container"> <!-- Main element, holds everything in place -->
  <div class="center"></div> <!-- Your content element (what you want in the center) -->
</div> <!-- /container -->
