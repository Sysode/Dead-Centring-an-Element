Dead Centre an Element 
-----------------------
Just something to help out others, plus myself, on how to dead centre something if it were to be inside a container fixed or fluid - works for both. Comments in-line help explain what is going on. However, basically making everything add up mathematically is the key to making sure it's dead centred, both horizontally and vertically.
